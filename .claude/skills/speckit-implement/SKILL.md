## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Pre-Execution Checks

**Check for extension hooks (before implementation)**:
- Check if `.specify/extensions.yml` exists in the project root.
- If it exists, read it and look for entries under the `hooks.before_implement` key
- If the YAML cannot be parsed or is invalid, skip hook checking silently and continue normally
- Filter out hooks where `enabled` is explicitly `false`. Treat hooks without an `enabled` field as enabled by default.
- For each remaining hook, do **not** attempt to interpret or evaluate hook `condition` expressions:
  - If the hook has no `condition` field, or it is null/empty, treat the hook as executable
  - If the hook defines a non-empty `condition`, skip the hook and leave condition evaluation to the HookExecutor implementation
- When constructing command invocations from hook command names, replace dots (`.`) with hyphens (`-`). For example, `speckit.git.commit` → `/speckit-git-commit`.
- For each executable hook, output the following based on its `optional` flag:
  - **Optional hook** (`optional: true`):
    ```
    ## Extension Hooks

    **Optional Pre-Hook**: {extension}
    Command: `/{command}`
    Description: {description}

    Prompt: {prompt}
    To execute: `/{command}`
    ```
  - **Mandatory hook** (`optional: false`):
    ```
    ## Extension Hooks

    **Automatic Pre-Hook**: {extension}
    Executing: `/{command}`
    EXECUTE_COMMAND: {command}

    Wait for the result of the hook command before proceeding to the Outline.
    ```
    After emitting the block above you MUST actually invoke the hook and wait for it to finish before continuing. Run it the same way you would run the command yourself in this agent/session (the invocation may differ from the literal `{command}` id shown above, e.g. a skills-mode agent runs it as `/skill:speckit-...` or `$speckit-...`). Emitting the block alone does not run the hook.
- If no hooks are registered or `.specify/extensions.yml` does not exist, skip silently

## Outline

### Step 0: Mode Detection

Before doing anything else, check whether a lightweight task (created by `/speckit-task`) is active:

- Read `.specify/active-task.json` if it exists.
- **If it exists AND its `status` is `"planning"` or `"implementing"` AND the referenced
  `<task_directory>/task.md` file exists** → follow **Lightweight Task Mode** below, and skip
  **Standard Spec Mode** entirely.
- **Otherwise** (no active-task.json, status is `"validated"`/`"completed"`/`"abandoned"`, or the
  referenced task.md is missing) → follow **Standard Spec Mode** below (the original, full
  `specs/<feature>/tasks.md` pipeline), unchanged.

---

### Lightweight Task Mode (`tasks/<slug>/` — Constitution Principle V, step 2)

This mode implements a small, self-contained task planned by `/speckit-task`. It is intentionally
narrower than Standard Spec Mode: it only writes code, nothing else.

1. Read `<task_directory>/task.md` (from `.specify/active-task.json`) in full: the Description,
   Business Rules/Constraints, Affected Service(s), and Implementation Checklist.
2. IF EXISTS: read `.specify/memory/constitution.md` — respect Principle I (monorepo service
   boundaries: only touch the affected service's directory), Principle II (hexagonal folder
   structure, Ports & Adapters isolation rules, and the naming convention), and Principle III
   (co-locate/author unit tests per the testing strategy, honoring the `@wip` exclusion rule if used).
3. Implement each unchecked checklist item in `task.md`, creating/editing files in the appropriate
   service directory:
   - Mark an item `[x]` in `task.md` as soon as it is genuinely completed.
   - If an item is intentionally skipped (e.g. out of scope, superseded by another item), leave it
     unchecked and add a one-line justification directly under it in the checklist.
4. **Hard constraint (NON-NEGOTIABLE per Constitution Principle V)**: this mode MUST NOT create a git
   commit, MUST NOT `git push`, and MUST NOT run the pipeline/build/test-suite simulation (e.g.
   `make validate-pipeline`). Only local file changes are allowed here — committing and validating
   are `/speckit-validate`'s job, and pushing is `/speckit-complete`'s job.
5. Once at least one checklist item has been implemented, update `.specify/active-task.json`:
   set `"status": "implementing"` (if it was still `"planning"`).
6. Update `task.md`'s `**Status**:` line to `Implementing`.
7. Do **not** proceed to Standard Spec Mode's steps below — go straight to the Completion Report.

---

### Standard Spec Mode (`specs/<feature>/tasks.md` pipeline — unchanged)

1. Run `python3 .specify/scripts/python/check_prerequisites.py --json --require-tasks --include-tasks` from repo root and parse FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS list. All paths must be absolute. For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot").

2. **Check checklists status** (if FEATURE_DIR/checklists/ exists):
   - Treat checklist markers as a read-only gate: scan checkbox state, report status, and ask before proceeding when needed; do NOT modify checklist files or markers
   - `checklists/requirements.md` is the built-in spec-quality checklist maintained by `/speckit-specify` and `/speckit-clarify`; custom checklists generated by `/speckit-checklist` are reviewer-owned requirements-quality review artifacts
   - For custom checklists, `[x]` means the reviewer determined the requirements-quality criterion is satisfied; it does NOT mean implementation work is complete
   - Scan all checklist files in the checklists/ directory
   - For each checklist, count:
     - Total items: All lines matching `- [ ]` or `- [X]` or `- [x]`
     - Checked items: Lines matching `- [X]` or `- [x]`
     - Unchecked items: Lines matching `- [ ]`
   - Create a status table:

     ```text
     | Checklist | Total | Checked | Unchecked | Status |
     |-----------|-------|---------|-----------|--------|
     | ux.md     | 12    | 12      | 0         | ✓ PASS |
     | test.md   | 8     | 5       | 3         | ✗ FAIL |
     | security.md | 6   | 6       | 0         | ✓ PASS |
     ```

   - Calculate overall status:
     - **PASS**: All checklists have 0 unchecked items
     - **FAIL**: One or more checklists have unchecked items

   - **If any checklist has unchecked items**:
     - Display the table with unchecked item counts
     - **STOP** and ask: "Some checklists have unchecked items. Do you want to proceed with implementation anyway? (yes/no)"
     - Wait for user response before continuing
     - If user says "no" or "wait" or "stop", halt execution
     - If user says "yes" or "proceed" or "continue", proceed to step 3

   - **If all checklists are checked**:
     - Display the table showing all checklists passed
     - Automatically proceed to step 3

3. Load and analyze the implementation context:
   - **REQUIRED**: Read tasks.md for the complete task list and execution plan
   - **REQUIRED**: Read plan.md for tech stack, architecture, and file structure
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read data-model.md for entities and relationships
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read contracts/ for API specifications and test requirements
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read research.md for technical decisions and constraints
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read .specify/memory/constitution.md for governance constraints
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read quickstart.md for integration scenarios

4. **Project Setup Verification**:
   - **REQUIRED**: Create/verify ignore files based on actual project setup:

   **Detection & Creation Logic**:
   - Check if the following command succeeds to determine if the repository is a git repo (create/verify .gitignore if so):

     ```sh
     git rev-parse --git-dir 2>/dev/null
     ```

   - Check if Dockerfile* exists or Docker in plan.md → create/verify .dockerignore
   - Check if .eslintrc* exists → create/verify .eslintignore
   - Check if eslint.config.* exists → ensure the config's `ignores` entries cover required patterns
   - Check if .prettierrc* exists → create/verify .prettierignore
   - Check if .npmrc or package.json exists → create/verify .npmignore (if publishing)
   - Check if terraform files (*.tf) exist → create/verify .terraformignore
   - Check if .helmignore needed (helm charts present) → create/verify .helmignore

   **If ignore file already exists**: Verify it contains essential patterns, append missing critical patterns only
   **If ignore file missing**: Create with full pattern set for detected technology

   **Common Patterns by Technology** (from plan.md tech stack):
   - **Node.js/JavaScript/TypeScript**: `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `*.log`, `.env*`
   - **Python**: `__pycache__/`, `*.pyc`, `.venv/`, `venv/`, `dist/`, `*.egg-info/`
   - **Java**: `target/`, `*.class`, `*.jar`, `.gradle/`, `build/`

   - **Kubernetes/k8s**: `*.secret.yaml`, `secrets/`, `.kube/`, `kubeconfig*`, `*.key`, `*.crt`

5. Parse tasks.md structure and extract:
   - **Task phases**: Setup, Tests, Core, Integration, Polish
   - **Task dependencies**: Sequential vs parallel execution rules
   - **Task details**: ID, description, file paths, parallel markers [P]
   - **Execution flow**: Order and dependency requirements

6. Execute implementation following the task plan:
   - **Phase-by-phase execution**: Complete each phase before moving to the next
   - **Respect dependencies**: Run sequential tasks in order, parallel tasks [P] can run together
   - **Follow TDD approach**: Execute test tasks before their corresponding implementation tasks
   - **File-based coordination**: Tasks affecting the same files must run sequentially
   - **Validation checkpoints**: Verify each phase completion before proceeding

7. Implementation execution rules:
   - **Setup first**: Initialize project structure, dependencies, configuration
   - **Tests before code**: If you need to write tests for contracts, entities, and integration scenarios
   - **Core development**: Implement models, services, CLI commands, endpoints
   - **Integration work**: Database connections, middleware, logging, external services
   - **Polish and validation**: Unit tests, performance optimization, documentation

8. Progress tracking and error handling:
   - Report progress after each completed task
   - Halt execution if any non-parallel task fails
   - For parallel tasks [P], continue with successful tasks, report failed ones
   - Provide clear error messages with context for debugging
   - Suggest next steps if implementation cannot proceed
   - **IMPORTANT** For completed tasks, make sure to mark the task off as [X] in the tasks file.

9. Completion validation:
   - Verify all required tasks are completed
   - Check that implemented features match the original specification
   - Validate that tests pass and coverage meets requirements
   - Confirm the implementation follows the technical plan

Note: This command assumes a complete task breakdown exists in tasks.md. If tasks are incomplete or missing, suggest running `/speckit-tasks` first to regenerate the task list.

## Mandatory Post-Execution Hooks

**You MUST complete this section before reporting completion to the user.**

Check if `.specify/extensions.yml` exists in the project root.
- If it does not exist, or no hooks are registered under `hooks.after_implement`, skip to the Completion Report.
- If it exists, read it and look for entries under the `hooks.after_implement` key.
- If the YAML cannot be parsed or is invalid, skip hook checking silently and continue to the Completion Report.
- Filter out hooks where `enabled` is explicitly `false`. Treat hooks without an `enabled` field as enabled by default.
- For each remaining hook, do **not** attempt to interpret or evaluate hook `condition` expressions:
  - If the hook has no `condition` field, or it is null/empty, treat the hook as executable
  - If the hook defines a non-empty `condition`, skip the hook and leave condition evaluation to the HookExecutor implementation
- When constructing command invocations from hook command names, replace dots (`.`) with hyphens (`-`). For example, `speckit.git.commit` → `/speckit-git-commit`.
- For each executable hook, output the following based on its `optional` flag:
  - **Mandatory hook** (`optional: false`) — **You MUST emit `EXECUTE_COMMAND:` for each mandatory hook**:
    ```
    ## Extension Hooks

    **Automatic Hook**: {extension}
    Executing: `/{command}`
    EXECUTE_COMMAND: {command}
    ```
    After emitting the block above you MUST actually invoke the hook and wait for it to finish before continuing. Run it the same way you would run the command yourself in this agent/session (the invocation may differ from the literal `{command}` id shown above, e.g. a skills-mode agent runs it as `/skill:speckit-...` or `$speckit-...`). Emitting the block alone does not run the hook.
  - **Optional hook** (`optional: true`):
    ```
    ## Extension Hooks

    **Optional Hook**: {extension}
    Command: `/{command}`
    Description: {description}

    Prompt: {prompt}
    To execute: `/{command}`
    ```

## Completion Report

- **If Lightweight Task Mode ran**: report which checklist items in `<task_directory>/task.md` were
  completed vs. skipped (with justification), remind the user that nothing was committed or pushed,
  and suggest `/speckit-validate` as the next command.
- **If Standard Spec Mode ran**: report final status with summary of completed work, as before.

## Done When

- [ ] **Lightweight Task Mode**: implemented checklist items in `task.md` are marked `[x]`, skipped
      ones carry a justification, `.specify/active-task.json` and `task.md` status are `"implementing"`,
      and no commit/push/pipeline run occurred
- [ ] **Standard Spec Mode**: all tasks in tasks.md completed and marked `[X]`, implementation validated
      against specification, plan, and test coverage
- [ ] Extension hooks dispatched or skipped according to the rules in Mandatory Post-Execution Hooks above
- [ ] Completion reported to user with summary of completed work and the correct next command
